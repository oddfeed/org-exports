Could you explain this to me

"Mark Fisher argued that "the pandemic of mental anguish that afflicts our time cannot be properly understood, or healed, if viewed as a private problem suffered by damaged individuals."[44]"

## Pro answer
Mark Fisher, a cultural theorist and writer, was known for his critical analysis of contemporary capitalism and its effects on society and the individual. In his work, Fisher frequently addressed the issue of mental health, particularly depression, and its relationship with the socio-economic system.

The quote you've provided encapsulates Fisher's perspective on the widespread issue of mental health in modern society. He believed that the high incidence of mental health problems, which he referred to as a "pandemic of mental anguish," cannot be fully comprehended or effectively addressed if they are seen merely as individual issues affecting certain "damaged" people [1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Fisher) [4](https://www.goodreads.com/author/quotes/956173.Mark_Fisher) [7](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jan/18/mark-fisher-k-punk-blogs-did-48-politics).

Fisher's argument is that mental health issues are not just personal or isolated problems but are deeply connected to the broader social and political context in which individuals live. He critiqued the prevailing view that mental illness is primarily a biological or chemical disorder, which can be resolved through medication or individual therapy alone. Instead, he suggested that the distress many people experience is a direct consequence of living under a capitalist system that prioritizes profit over human well-being, fosters isolation, and imposes unrealistic standards of success and productivity [1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Fisher) [2](https://www.artmonthly.co.uk/magazine/site/article/mark-fisher-remembered-by-ashiya-eastwood-march-2017) [4](https://www.goodreads.com/author/quotes/956173.Mark_Fisher) [5](https://stawa.org/mark-fisher-linking-mental-health-with-capitalism/).

By stating that mental health issues should not be viewed as private problems, Fisher was calling for a repoliticization of mental health. He urged a shift in focus from the individual to the collective, suggesting that societal structures and the pressures they create play a significant role in the mental health crisis. This perspective implies that any attempt to heal the "pandemic of mental anguish" must involve addressing the systemic issues at the root of the crisis, such as economic inequality, job insecurity, social isolation, and the commodification of every aspect of life [1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Fisher) [2](https://www.artmonthly.co.uk/magazine/site/article/mark-fisher-remembered-by-ashiya-eastwood-march-2017) [4](https://www.goodreads.com/author/quotes/956173.Mark_Fisher) [5](https://stawa.org/mark-fisher-linking-mental-health-with-capitalism/).

Fisher's work, particularly his book "Capitalist Realism: Is There No Alternative?", explores these themes in depth, offering a critique of the way capitalism has shaped not only the economy but also the very way we think about and experience mental health [1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Fisher) [4](https://www.goodreads.com/author/quotes/956173.Mark_Fisher) [8](https://files.libcom.org/files/Capitalist%20Realism_%20Is%20There%20No%20Alternat%20-%20Mark%20Fisher.pdf).
