## Prompt:
Is a pilot g tec c4 compatible with a pilot hi tec c?

## Response:
The Pilot G-Tec-C4 and the Pilot Hi-Tec-C are actually the same pen marketed under different names in different regions. In some areas, it's known as the Pilot G-Tec-C, while in others, it's called the Pilot Hi-Tec-C. Therefore, they use the same refills and have the same features. If you have a refill or part from one, it should be compatible with the other.
